# Quora_Question_Pair_Similarity

1. Quora is a repository of question answers.
2. Given 2 questions Q1 and Q2, we have to determine if one of the question is a duplicate of other.
3. Business relevance of question -- Suppose a user post a new question which is worded differently than an already asked question. We can identify that new question is duplicate of already existing question & link the answers of it to the new question, thereby improving user experience. It is waste of effort & time to answer again a new question which has already been answered in the past.
4. Quora already has a solution in production which uses Random forest.
